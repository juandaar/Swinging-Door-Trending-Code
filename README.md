The Swinging Door Trending (SDT) is a lossy data compression algorithm. SDT uses a simple method of linear interpolation to compress the samples by trend lines. A C++ and a python version were made, the 
1st to esp8266 devices and the 2nd to simulations.  The project has more codes but they are part of my dissertation.

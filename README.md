The Swinging Door Trending (SDT) is a lossy data compression algorithm. SDT uses a simple method of linear interpolation to compress the samples by trend lines. I made a C++ and a python version, the 
1st to esp8266 devices and the 2nd to simulations. 
The project has more codes but they are part of my dissertation. The code has few comments because I did not intend to share it
